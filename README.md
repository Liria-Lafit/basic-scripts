- ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!
This is just some neat basic things to help "me" do quick install of some basic packages on a minimal install.

- The current install.sh is a basic modification of dewgrif JustAGuyLinux:https://github.com/drewgrif/bookworm-scripts

- I did this "mod" as a test to learn a little about bash. kek
- more scripts will be created as i try new distros :D
