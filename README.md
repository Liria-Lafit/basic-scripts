- ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!
This is just some neat scripts to help "me" do quick install of some basic packages on a minimal install.

- The current bash install is a basic modification of dewgrif JustAGuyLinux:https://github.com/drewgrif/bookworm-scripts

I did this "mod" as a test to learn a little about bash. kek
# Bookworm Script
```
wget https://github.com/Liria-Lafit/basic-scripts/raw/main/debianbookworm/fastbasics.sh

chmod +x fastbasics.sh

./install.sh
```
